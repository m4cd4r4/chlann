# ChlannClaude Docker Setup and Troubleshooting

## Changes Made to Fix Docker Compose Issues

1. **Created .env file in the docker directory**
   - Based on .env.example but with development-appropriate values
   - Set NODE_ENV to development to enable development mode features

2. **Fixed port mismatches**
   - Updated docker-compose.dev.yml to use ports 3003 and 3004 to match the service files
   - This ensures the containers' exposed ports match what the services expect

3. **Fixed Redis configuration**
   - Updated environment variables in search-service to use REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT, and REDIS_PASSWORD
   - These match what the search-service index.js file expects

4. **Created missing utility files**
   - Added missing logger.js utility for the media-service
   - Added missing auth middleware for both services
   - Added missing upload middleware for media-service

5. **Added controllers and routes implementations**
   - Created basic controllers for both services with mock implementations
   - This allows for testing the API endpoints during development

## How to Run the Project

1. Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
   - Docker and Docker Compose
   - Node.js 16+ (for local development outside containers)

2. From the project root directory, start the development environment:
   ```
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up
   ```

3. The following services will be available:
   - MongoDB: http://localhost:27017
   - Redis: localhost:6379
   - MinIO: http://localhost:9000 (API) and http://localhost:9001 (Console)
   - Media Service API: http://localhost:3003
   - Search Service API: http://localhost:3004

4. To access the MinIO console, navigate to http://localhost:9001 and use:
   - Username: minioadmin
   - Password: minioadmin

## Testing the Services

### Media Service
- Check the health endpoint: http://localhost:3003/health
- List media (mock data): http://localhost:3003/

### Search Service
- Check search functionality: http://localhost:3004/?query=test
- Browse content by dates: http://localhost:3004/date-range

## Potential Future Improvements

1. Add authentication service and implement proper JWT-based authentication
2. Add messaging service for real-time messaging capabilities
3. Implement actual MongoDB models and schemas for both services
4. Set up proper MinIO bucket creation and management
5. Add API gateway to route requests to appropriate services
6. Implement React Native mobile application to connect to these services
