# Media Gallery Search Functionality Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for adding comprehensive search capabilities to the Media Gallery in the ChlannClaude app. The search feature will allow users to find specific media items quickly through text search, filters, and advanced criteria.

## Core Features

1. **Text-based Search**
   - Search by filename, caption, and metadata
   - Auto-complete and suggestions
   - Search history for quick access

2. **Filters & Advanced Search**
   - Filter by media type (photos, videos, documents)
   - Filter by date ranges
   - Filter by location
   - Filter by quality/resolution

3. **Search Results Display**
   - Dynamic grid layout for search results
   - Quick preview capabilities
   - Relevance highlighting

4. **Search Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient indexing
   - Incremental search (search-as-you-type)
   - Caching of recent searches

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Search Interface (2 days)

1. **Create Core Components**
   - Implement `MediaSearchScreen` with basic layout
   - Develop `SearchBar` component with text input
   - Build `SearchResults` grid component

2. **Implement Basic Search Logic**
   - Create `useMediaSearch` hook with basic search functionality
   - Set up Redux integration for search state
   - Implement simple filtering by text

### Phase 2: Advanced Filters & Search Refinement (2 days)

1. **Filter Components**
   - Create `SearchFilters` component with expandable options
   - Implement date range selector
   - Add media type filter chips
   - Develop location-based filtering

2. **Filter Logic**
   - Create `useSearchFilters` hook to manage filter state
   - Implement filter combination logic
   - Add sort options (newest, oldest, relevance)

### Phase 3: User Experience Enhancements (1 day)

1. **Search History**
   - Implement `SearchHistory` component
   - Create storage mechanism for recent searches
   - Add quick search suggestions based on history

2. **Visual Refinements**
   - Add animations for filter transitions
   - Implement loading states and skeletons
   - Add empty state for no results

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization (1 day)

1. **Search Efficiency**
   - Implement debouncing for search-as-you-type
   - Add pagination for large result sets
   - Create caching layer for recent searches

2. **Result Presentation**
   - Add relevance highlighting in results
   - Implement quick preview on long press
   - Add subtle animations for results loading

## Detailed Component Specifications

### MediaSearchScreen

The main container component that orchestrates the search experience. It will:
- Manage the overall search state
- Coordinate between search input, filters, and results
- Handle navigation to detailed views

```javascript
// Simplified structure
const MediaSearchScreen = () => {
  const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');
  const [activeFilters, setActiveFilters] = useState({});
  const { results, loading, error } = useMediaSearch(searchQuery, activeFilters);
  
  // Rendering logic for search components
  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <SearchBar 
        value={searchQuery} 
        onChangeText={setSearchQuery} 
      />
      <SearchFilters 
        filters={activeFilters} 
        onChange={setActiveFilters} 
      />
      <SearchResults 
        data={results} 
        loading={loading} 
      />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};
```

### SearchBar Component

A customized input component with enhanced search features:
- Clean, prominent search input
- Voice search capability
- Auto-suggestions dropdown
- Clear button and search history access

### SearchFilters Component

An expandable/collapsible set of filter controls:
- Date range selector (calendar or relative options)
- Media type toggles (images, videos, etc.)
- Location selection with map integration
- Quality/size filters
- Save filter combinations

### SearchResults Component

An optimized grid display of search results:
- Variable columns based on screen size
- Progressive image loading
- Smooth scrolling with virtualization
- Pull-to-refresh for updating results

## API Integration

The search functionality will require these API endpoints:

```
GET /api/media/search
  Query params:
  - q: string (search query)
  - type: string[] (media types)
  - startDate: ISO date
  - endDate: ISO date
  - location: string (location name or coordinates)
  - quality: string (minimum quality level)
  - limit: number (results per page)
  - offset: number (pagination)
```

## Redux Integration

We'll extend the existing media slice to include search state:

```javascript
// Search-related portion of the Redux state
{
  media: {
    // ... existing media state
    search: {
      query: '',
      results: [],
      filters: {
        types: [],
        dateRange: { start: null, end: null },
        location: null,
        quality: null
      },
      pagination: {
        page: 1,
        hasMore: true
      },
      history: [], // Recent searches
      loading: false,
      error: null
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test search filtering logic
   - Test component rendering states
   - Test Redux actions and reducers

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test search API integration
   - Test filter combinations
   - Test pagination and result loading

3. **User Testing**
   - Validate search UX with user testing
   - Test performance with large media libraries
   - Gather feedback on filter usability

## File Size Management

To keep files under 300 lines:
- Split complex components into smaller subcomponents
- Use custom hooks to extract logic from components
- Leverage utility functions for repetitive operations
- Keep Redux actions and reducers focused on specific functions

## Success Criteria

The search functionality will be considered successful when it enables users to:
1. Find specific media items within 2-3 seconds
2. Filter results with intuitive controls
3. Navigate search results efficiently
4. Return to previous searches easily

The implementation should provide a seamless experience that feels integrated with the rest of the Media Gallery, while maintaining high performance even with large media collections.
