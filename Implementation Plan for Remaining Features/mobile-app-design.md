# Mobile App UI/UX Design

## Design Philosophy

For a messaging app focused on high-resolution media sharing, the UI/UX design should follow these principles:

1. **Media-First Experience**: Design that showcases visual content with minimal UI interference
2. **Progressive Loading**: Fast initial loads with seamless quality improvements
3. **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear paths to access media collections and conversations
4. **Performance Optimization**: UI that performs well even with heavy media content
5. **Minimalist Interface**: Clean design that doesn't compete with visual media

## Design System

### Color Palette

A neutral color palette with accent colors that don't compete with media content:

```
Primary: #2B68E6 (Blue)
Secondary: #34C759 (Green)
Background: #FFFFFF (White)
Surface: #F7F7F7 (Light Gray)
Dark Surface: #2C2C2E (Dark Gray)
Text Primary: #121212 (Near Black)
Text Secondary: #646464 (Medium Gray)
Dividers: #E5E5E5 (Light Gray)
```

### Typography

Clear, legible typography optimized for mobile screens:

```
Headings: SF Pro Display (iOS) / Roboto (Android)
